These are projects I made using JavaScript.

Tic Tac Toe
This version of the classic game allows the players to use Grumpy Cat or a Leaping Pitbull for their token. The program uses a randomizer to select which player goes first, a tie game results in a buzzer, and the winner is given a celebratory trumpet. 

Pizza Menu
For this project the user is given a selection of various sizes and toppings for their pizza. Once they have made their selections they are listed and a price is displayed.

Calculator
This simple 4 function calculator can be used for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. 
Other Projects
Various other projects are also included that demonstrate among other things: expressions alerts, functions, math operators, dictionaries, string methods and loops arrays.
